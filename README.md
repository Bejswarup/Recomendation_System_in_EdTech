The purpose of this project report is to outline the implementation and impact
of recommender systems powered by machine learning algorithms in the field
of education technology (Ed-tech). Recommender systems play a crucial role in
facilitating personalized learning experiences for students by recommending relevant and engaging learning resources, such as books, videos, or online courses.
By leveraging studentsâ€™ interests, prior knowledge, and learning patterns, these
systems promote self-directed learning and enhance educational outcomes.
